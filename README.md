You can choose inside which languages to show the context menu with the following setting.  
Include `"*"` if you want the context menu to always be shown.
Default values are below.
```json
"json2go.contextMenu.supportedLanguages": [
        "javascript",
        "typescript",
        "json",
        "jsonc",
        "html",
        "go"
    ]
```

####  <font color="green">Inline type definitions</font>


The checkbox allows you to generate nested types as inline structs:

```go
type Autogenerated struct {
	Employees []struct {
		Name string `json:"name"`
		Email string `json:"email"`
	} `json:"employees"`
}
```

Or below the main struct:

```go
type Autogenerated struct {
	Employees []Employee `json:"employees"`
}
type Employee struct {
	Name string `json:"name"`
	Email string `json:"email"`
}
